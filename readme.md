## Introduction

The current ofVideoGrabber only lists the camera names.

```
  device 0 = FaceTime HD Camera
  device 1 = Logitech Camera
  device 0 = CC2431570MNF6VVDP
  device 1 = 0x14100000046d09a6
  device 0 = Apple Camera VendorID_0x106B ProductID_0x1570
  device 1 = UVC Camera VendorID_1133 ProductID_2470
```
